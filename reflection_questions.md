I learned how to design and implement a normalized database schema, use SQL for advanced data analysis, and update data dynamically to reflect real-world scenarios.

3. What could you improve or do differently next time?
I could optimize the database structure further by incorporating triggers or stored procedures to automate stock updates and calculations for improved efficiency.
